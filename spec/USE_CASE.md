## Use Case 1: Online Verifier — AI Pipeline Context Verification

### Scenario: Building a Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline

**Background:**
A data scientist requests an AI Agent to create a new pipeline: "Build a daily customer churn prediction pipeline using user activity and payment data."

#### Without DataSpoke
The AI Agent would:
1. Search DataHub for "user" and "payment" tables
2. Select tables based on naming conventions alone
3. Generate code without understanding data quality or usage patterns
4. Deploy a pipeline that might use deprecated or unreliable data sources

#### With DataSpoke

**Step 1: Semantic Discovery**
```
AI Agent Query: "Find user activity and payment tables suitable for ML training"

DataSpoke Response:
- users.activity_events (✓ High Quality Score: 95)
  - Last refreshed: 2 hours ago
  - Data completeness: 99.8%
  - Usage: 45 downstream consumers

- users.activity_logs (⚠ Quality Issues Detected)
  - Anomaly: 30% drop in row count since yesterday
  - Missing field rate increased to 15%
  - Recommendation: Avoid until investigation complete

- payments.transactions (✓ Recommended)
  - SLA: 99.9% on-time delivery
  - Documentation coverage: 100%
  - Certified for ML use
```

**Step 2: Context Verification**
```python
# AI Agent calls the Context Verification API
dataspoke.verification.verify_context("users.activity_logs")

Response:
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "quality_issues": [
    {
      "type": "volume_anomaly",
      "detected_at": "2024-02-09T08:30:00Z",
      "severity": "high",
      "message": "Daily row count dropped from 5M to 3.5M",
      "recommendation": "Use users.activity_events instead"
    }
  ],
  "alternative_entities": ["users.activity_events"],
  "blocking_issues": ["ongoing_investigation"]
}
```

**Step 3: Autonomous Verification**
Before deployment, DataSpoke validates the generated pipeline:

```yaml
Pipeline: customer_churn_prediction_v1
Author: AI Agent (claude-sonnet-4.5)

Validation Results:
✓ Documentation:
  - Description: Present and comprehensive
  - Owner: Assigned to data-science-team
  - Business context: Explained

✓ Naming Convention:
  - Table name: customer_churn_features (follows standard)
  - Column names: snake_case (compliant)

✓ Quality Checks:
  - NULL handling: Implemented
  - Schema evolution: Backward compatible

✓ Lineage Impact:
  - Upstream dependencies: 2 tables (both healthy)
  - Downstream impact: None (new pipeline)
  - Circular dependency: None detected

⚠ Recommendations:
  - Consider adding data freshness check
  - Suggest implementing monitoring alert
```

**Step 4: Deployment with Confidence**
The AI Agent deploys the pipeline with:
- Verified data sources
- Compliant code structure
- Automated quality checks
- Complete documentation

**Outcome:**
- 🎯 Zero production incidents from data quality issues
- ⚡ 80% reduction in human review time
- 📊 Immediate integration with existing monitoring

## Use Case 2: Quality Control — Predictive SLA Management

### Scenario: E-commerce Order Processing Pipeline

**Background:**
A critical `orders.daily_summary` table powers real-time dashboards for business operations. The pipeline typically processes 2-3M rows daily by 9 AM.

#### Traditional Monitoring Approach
```
Alert: orders.daily_summary is empty at 9:00 AM
Status: SLA BREACH - Business dashboard down
Response: Manual investigation required
```

#### DataSpoke Predictive Approach

**Day 1 - Monday 7:00 AM: Early Warning**
```
DataSpoke Alert (Predictive):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠ Anomaly Detection: orders.daily_summary
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Model: Prophet Time Series Analysis
Confidence: 89%

Observation:
  Current volume at 7:00 AM: 450K rows
  Expected volume (Mon 7AM): 1.2M rows ±5%
  Deviation: -62% (outside 3σ threshold)

Historical Pattern:
  Mon 7AM avg (last 8 weeks): 1.18M rows
  Mon 9AM completion rate: 98.5%

Prediction:
  📉 Likely to miss 9AM SLA by 1.5 hours
  🎯 Expected completion: 10:30 AM

Upstream Analysis:
  orders.raw_events:
    ✓ Normal volume (2.8M rows at 6:30 AM)
  orders.payment_status:
    ⚠ Delayed by 30 minutes (unusual)
    └─ Dependency: payment_gateway_api.transactions
       └─ Issue: API rate limit exceeded

Root Cause (Likely):
  Payment gateway API throttling affecting upstream join

Recommended Actions:
  1. Check payment_gateway_api rate limits
  2. Contact payment team about API quota
  3. Consider temporary bypass using cached data

Impact:
  Affected Dashboards: 3
  - Executive Sales Dashboard (15 viewers)
  - Operations Real-time Monitor (8 viewers)
  - Finance Daily Report (auto-scheduled)
```

**7:15 AM - Proactive Response**
Engineering team receives alert and takes action:
1. Confirms payment API throttling
2. Implements temporary increased rate limit
3. Pipeline recovers by 8:00 AM
4. SLA met with 1 hour buffer

**Result Comparison:**

| Metric | Traditional Monitoring | DataSpoke Predictive |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Detection Time | 9:00 AM (breach) | 7:00 AM (pre-breach) |
| Response Window | 0 min (already late) | 120 min (proactive) |
| Business Impact | 2hr dashboard downtime | Zero downtime |
| MTTR | 90 minutes | 45 minutes |
| Root Cause ID | 60 minutes investigation | 2 minutes (auto-analyzed) |

**Week 2 - Pattern Learning**
```
DataSpoke Insight:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 Weekly Pattern Analysis: orders.daily_summary
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Anomaly Detected (Low Severity):
  Pattern: Monday 7AM volume consistently -10% vs other weekdays
  Duration: Last 4 weeks
  Status: Not blocking SLA, but diverging from baseline

Hypothesis:
  Weekend payment processing batch delay?

Suggestion:
  Adjust Monday morning baseline expectation
  OR investigate weekend batch schedule

Auto-adjusted Threshold:
  Monday 7AM: 1.08M ±5% (updated from 1.18M)
```

## Use Case 3: Knowledge Base — Semantic Data Discovery

### Scenario: Privacy Compliance Audit

**Background:**
Legal team needs to prepare for GDPR audit and requests: "Identify all tables containing European user PII that are accessed by marketing analytics pipelines."

#### Traditional DataHub Search
```sql
-- Manual search process:
1. Search for "user" tables
2. Check each table description for "EU" or "Europe"
3. Grep column names for "email", "name", "address"
4. Check lineage manually for marketing connections
5. Review 50+ tables manually

Time Required: 4-6 hours
Accuracy: 70% (depends on documentation quality)
```

#### DataSpoke Semantic Search API

**Query:**
```
Natural Language Input:
"Find tables with European user PII used by marketing analytics"
```

**DataSpoke Processing:**
```python
# Step 1: Semantic Understanding
parsed_query = {
  "intent": "data_discovery",
  "filters": {
    "data_category": ["PII", "personal_data"],
    "geographic_scope": ["EU", "Europe", "GDPR"],
    "domain": ["user_data", "customer_data"],
    "consuming_team": ["marketing", "analytics"]
  },
  "compliance_context": "GDPR"
}

# Step 2: Vector Search + Graph Traversal
results = dataspoke.knowledge_base.semantic_search(
  query=parsed_query,
  search_method="hybrid",  # Vector similarity + Graph lineage
  compliance_mode=True
)
```

## Use Case 5: Self-Purification — AI-Driven Ontology Design

### Scenario: Resolving Semantic Drift After a Company Acquisition

**Background:**
A fintech company acquires a smaller payments startup. Post-acquisition, the combined DataHub catalog contains 800+ datasets — 300 from the acquired company — with overlapping concepts, conflicting naming conventions, and duplicated entities. The data governance team cannot manually audit and reconcile 800 datasets.

#### The Problem: Semantic Drift at Scale
```
Before DataSpoke Self-Purification:

Concept: "Customer"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Legacy system (core company):
  - users.customers           → id, email, signup_date
  - crm.client_master         → client_id, contact_email, created_at
  - analytics.user_profiles   → user_uuid, email_address, registration_ts

Acquired company:
  - payments.payer_registry   → payer_ref, payer_email, onboarded_at
  - risk.account_holders      → acct_id, email, account_opened
  - kyc.verified_identities   → identity_id, email_addr, verified_date

Problems:
  ✗ 6 tables all represent "Customer" with different schemas
  ✗ No documented relationship between them
  ✗ Downstream pipelines join across them inconsistently
  ✗ AI agents cannot reliably identify the "right" customer table
  ✗ Compliance reports double-count customers
```

#### DataSpoke Self-Purification: Ontology Analysis

**Phase 1: Semantic Clustering**
```
DataSpoke Self-Purification Report:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 Semantic Clustering Analysis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Analyzed: 800 datasets
Semantic clusters detected: 47
Clusters with conflicts: 12
Critical conflicts (AI agents affected): 4

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Cluster: CUSTOMER IDENTITY (Critical)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

6 tables detected representing the same concept:

Similarity Matrix (embedding cosine distance):
  users.customers           ←→ crm.client_master         0.94
  users.customers           ←→ analytics.user_profiles   0.91
  users.customers           ←→ payments.payer_registry   0.88
  payments.payer_registry   ←→ risk.account_holders      0.92
  risk.account_holders      ←→ kyc.verified_identities   0.89

Conflict Type: ENTITY DUPLICATION
Evidence:
  - All 6 contain email-like fields (semantic match: 100%)
  - All 6 contain a creation timestamp (semantic match: 95%)
  - Overlapping downstream lineage: 23 shared consumers
  - Sample record overlap (estimated): 78%

AI Agent Impact:
  - 12 AI-generated pipelines query ≥2 of these tables
  - 3 pipelines produce inconsistent customer counts
  - Context Verification API returning warnings on 8 pipelines
```

**Phase 2: Ontology Proposal**
```
DataSpoke Self-Purification:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📐 Proposed Ontology — CUSTOMER IDENTITY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Recommendation: Define a canonical "Customer" entity

Canonical Entity (proposed):
  Name: enterprise.customer_master
  Concept: The single unified record of a customer across all systems
  Fields (merged schema):
    - customer_id          (surrogate key, new)
    - email                (normalized from 6 variants)
    - source_system        (origin: "core" | "acquired")
    - legacy_id_core       (maps to users.customers.id)
    - legacy_id_acquired   (maps to payments.payer_registry.payer_ref)
    - created_at           (earliest of all source timestamps)
    - kyc_verified         (from kyc.verified_identities)
    - risk_score           (from risk.account_holders)

Proposed Table Roles:
  ┌──────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐
  │ Table                        │ Proposed Role               │
  ├──────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
  │ enterprise.customer_master   │ NEW — canonical SSOT        │
  │ users.customers              │ Deprecated → migrate to new │
  │ crm.client_master            │ CRM view (keep, alias only) │
  │ analytics.user_profiles      │ Analytics view (keep)       │
  │ payments.payer_registry      │ Payments system view (keep) │
  │ risk.account_holders         │ Risk view (keep)            │
  │ kyc.verified_identities      │ KYC view (keep)             │
  └──────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘

Consistency Rules (proposed):
  R1. All new pipelines MUST join on enterprise.customer_master
  R2. email field must be normalized to lowercase + stripped
  R3. customer_id is immutable once assigned
  R4. source_system tag required on all customer-originating events

Impact Assessment:
  Pipelines requiring update: 23
  Estimated migration effort: Medium (schema additive, not breaking)
  Downstream dashboard impact: 5 dashboards need customer_id added

## Use Case 6: Ingestion — Legacy System Metadata Integration

### Scenario: Ingesting Metadata from a Legacy Oracle Data Warehouse

**Background:**
A financial services company has a 15-year-old Oracle data warehouse containing 200+ critical tables and stored procedures that power regulatory reporting. This legacy system predates DataHub adoption and uses custom documentation stored in Confluence pages, Excel spreadsheets, and tribal knowledge. Standard DataHub connectors can extract basic schema information but miss critical business context, data lineage from stored procedures, and custom data quality rules embedded in application logic.

#### Traditional DataHub Connector Limitations

```
Standard Oracle Connector Output:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Schema extracted: 200 tables
✓ Column types: Captured
✓ Primary keys: Detected

✗ Business descriptions: Missing (stored in Confluence)
✗ Data quality rules: Missing (embedded in PL/SQL)
✗ Stored procedure lineage: Not supported
✗ Regulatory tags: Missing (tracked in Excel)
✗ Update schedules: Missing (managed by legacy scheduler)
✗ Data owners: Missing (HR system)

Result: 200 tables in DataHub with technical metadata only
Impact: Data consumers cannot determine which tables are safe to use
```
