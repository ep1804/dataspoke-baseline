## Overview

The DataSpoke API is a FastAPI (Python 3.11+) service that acts as the single ingress for
all DataSpoke clients — the portal UI and external AI agents. It exposes a three-tier URI
structure that maps directly to the user-group taxonomy defined in the MANIFESTO:

```
/api/v1/spoke/common/…     — Cross-cutting features shared across DE, DA, and DG
/api/v1/spoke/de/…         — Data Engineering features
/api/v1/spoke/da/…         — Data Analysis features
/api/v1/spoke/dg/…         — Data Governance features
/api/v1/hub/…              — DataHub pass-through (optional ingress for clients)
```

The API is the only **HTTP-facing** component for external clients (the portal UI and
AI agents). Backend services and Temporal workers also access DataHub, PostgreSQL, Redis,
Qdrant, and Temporal directly but are not exposed over HTTP.

```
Browser / AI Agent

```

### API-First Design

Standalone OpenAPI 3.0 specifications live in `api/` as independent artifacts. AI agents
and the frontend team iterate on those specs without a running backend. The FastAPI
implementation must remain consistent with those artifacts. When a route changes, update
`api/` first, then the implementation.

---

## Authentication & Authorization

### Token Strategy

DataSpoke uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication.

| Token type | Lifetime | Storage |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Access token | 15 minutes | Memory / `Authorization` header |
| Refresh token | 7 days | HttpOnly cookie |

Token issuance and refresh are handled at:
- `POST /auth/token` — issue access + refresh tokens (credential exchange)
- `POST /auth/token/refresh` — issue new access token from refresh token
- `POST /auth/token/revoke` — revoke refresh token (logout)

### JWT Claims

```json
{
  "sub": "user-uuid",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "groups": ["de"],
  "exp": 1234567890,
  "iat": 1234567890
}
```

The `groups` claim is an array of user-group identifiers (`de`, `da`, `dg`). A user may
belong to multiple groups. The middleware enforces that a request targeting
`/spoke/de/…` must have `"de"` in the `groups` claim.

### Group-to-Route Access Control

| URI tier | Required group claim | Accessible to |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| `/spoke/common/…` | any valid group | DE, DA, DG |
| `/spoke/de/…` | `"de"` | DE (and admins) — reserved; no routes currently defined |
| `/spoke/da/…` | `"da"` | DA (and admins) — reserved; no routes currently defined |
| `/spoke/dg/…` | `"dg"` | DG (and admins) |
| `/hub/…` | any valid group | DE, DA, DG |
| `/auth/…` | none (public) | unauthenticated clients |
| `/admin/…` | `"admin"` | admins only |

### Admin Role

Users with `"admin"` in `groups` bypass group-tier restrictions and can call any route.
Admin routes (user management, system configuration) live under `/api/v1/admin/…` and
require the `"admin"` claim exclusively.

### Auth Flow

```
Client                       DataSpoke API              Identity Store
  │                               │                          │

```

## Route Catalogue

All routes are prefixed with `/api/v1`. Routes marked **WS** are WebSocket endpoints.

> **User-group routing principle**: User-group-specific paths (`/spoke/de/…`,
> `/spoke/da/…`, `/spoke/dg/…`) should be defined **only when a feature is exclusively
> used by that user group**. For dataset-centric operations — ingestion, validation,
> generation, search — the `/spoke/common/data/{dataset_urn}/…` structure is preferred
> so that any team owning a dataset can access the feature regardless of group membership.
> As a result, the current catalogue has no `/spoke/de` or `/spoke/da` sections; all
> shared dataset operations live under `/spoke/common`.

### Auth

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/auth/token` | Issue access + refresh tokens |
| `POST` | `/auth/token/refresh` | Refresh access token |
| `POST` | `/auth/token/revoke` | Revoke refresh token (logout) |

### Common (`/spoke/common`)

Cross-cutting features consumed by multiple user groups.

#### Ontology

| Method | Path | Purpose | Feature | UC |
|--------|------|---------|---------|-----|
| `GET` | `/spoke/common/ontology` | List concept categories | Ontology Builder | UC4, UC8 |
| `GET` | `/spoke/common/ontology/{concept_id}` | Get concept detail + relationships | Ontology Builder | UC4, UC8 |
| `GET` | `/spoke/common/ontology/{concept_id}/attr` | Get concept attributes (confidence, parent) | Ontology Builder | UC4 |
| `GET` | `/spoke/common/ontology/{concept_id}/event` | Change history for a concept | Ontology Builder | UC4 |
| `POST` | `/spoke/common/ontology/{concept_id}/method/approve` | Approve a pending concept proposal | Ontology Builder | UC4 |
| `POST` | `/spoke/common/ontology/{concept_id}/method/reject` | Reject a pending concept proposal | Ontology Builder | UC4 |

#### Data Resource (`/spoke/common/data/{dataset_urn}`)

The canonical resource for a dataset. All teams (DE, DA, DG) access dataset attributes,
ingestion, validation, and generation through this shared path. Ingestion, validation,
and generation are organized under `attr/` with parallel sub-resource structures: `conf`
(configurations with status), `method` (action triggers), and `event` (success/failure
notices). Validation and generation additionally have `result` (periodic results as
timeseries). In a data-mesh organization any team that owns a dataset can register and
manage ingestion, validation, and generation — DE teams provide deep technical specs
while DA or other teams may register simpler configurations.

#### Ingestion (`/spoke/common/ingestion`)

A cross-dataset view of ingestion configurations and events. Each entry combines dataset
identity with the ingestion data stored under
`common/data/{dataset_urn}/attr/ingestion/`. Useful for operations dashboards and bulk
management.

#### Generation (`/spoke/common/gen`)

A cross-dataset view of generation configurations, results, and events. Each entry
combines dataset identity with the generation data stored under
`common/data/{dataset_urn}/attr/gen/`. Useful for monitoring generation status across
all datasets and bulk management.

| Method | Path | Purpose | Feature | UC |
|--------|------|---------|---------|-----|

#### Search (`/spoke/common/search`)

Natural language search over dataset metadata using vector similarity. Available to all
user groups. Accepts `?sql_context=true` to include text-to-SQL optimized column detail,
sample values, and inferred join paths in the response — superseding the former dedicated
text-to-SQL and join-paths paths.

| Method | Path | Purpose | Feature | UC |
|--------|------|---------|---------|-----|
| `GET` | `/spoke/common/search` | Natural language search (`?q=…`; add `?sql_context=true` for SQL context + join paths) | Natural Language Search, Text-to-SQL Metadata | UC5, UC7 |
| `POST` | `/spoke/common/search/method/reindex` | Trigger reindex for a dataset (`?dataset_urn=…`) | Natural Language Search | UC5 |

### Data Governance (`/spoke/dg`)

#### Metric (`/spoke/dg/metric`)

Governance metrics are named, configurable measurements tracked over time — for example,
the count of poorly documented datasets, the count of erroneous datasets per medallion
layer, or data downtime duration. Each metric carries a definition (`attr/conf`) that
controls how it is computed, scheduled, and alerted, and a timeseries of measurement
results (`attr/result`). Metrics represent enterprise-wide or department-wide signals
rather than per-dataset observations.

| Method | Path | Purpose | Feature | UC |
|--------|------|---------|---------|-----|
| `GET` | `/spoke/dg/metric` | List all metrics (paginated; filterable by theme, status) | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| `GET` | `/spoke/dg/metric/{metric_id}` | Get metric summary (identity, theme, active status) | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| `GET` | `/spoke/dg/metric/{metric_id}/attr` | Get metric attributes overview (theme, period, active status, alarm enabled) | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| `GET` | `/spoke/dg/metric/{metric_id}/attr/conf` | Get full metric definition (title, theme, measurement period, alarm setup, active status) | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| `PUT` | `/spoke/dg/metric/{metric_id}/attr/conf` | Create or replace metric definition | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| `PATCH` | `/spoke/dg/metric/{metric_id}/attr/conf` | Update metric definition fields | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| `DELETE` | `/spoke/dg/metric/{metric_id}/attr/conf` | Remove metric definition | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| `GET` | `/spoke/dg/metric/{metric_id}/attr/result` | Get measurement results (numeric timeseries; `?from=…&to=…` for time range) | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| `POST` | `/spoke/dg/metric/{metric_id}/method/run` | Trigger a metric measurement run | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| `POST` | `/spoke/dg/metric/{metric_id}/method/activate` | Activate metric (enable scheduled measurement) | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| `POST` | `/spoke/dg/metric/{metric_id}/method/deactivate` | Deactivate metric | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| `GET` | `/spoke/dg/metric/{metric_id}/event` | Metric run events and alarm notices | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |
| **WS** | `/spoke/dg/metric/stream` | Real-time metric update stream | Enterprise Metrics Dashboard | UC6 |

#### Overview (`/spoke/dg/overview`)

Additional perspectives on the data estate that cannot be expressed as per-metric
timeseries: graph-based topology views, medallion layer coverage maps, and similar
structural views. Use these paths only when the `/spoke/dg/metric` routes are
insufficient to represent the data needed.

| Method | Path | Purpose | Feature | UC |
|--------|------|---------|---------|-----|
| `GET` | `/spoke/dg/overview` | Get multi-perspective overview snapshot (graph + medallion coverage) | Multi-Perspective Data Overview | UC8 |
| `GET` | `/spoke/dg/overview/attr` | Get visualization config (layout, coloring, filters) | Multi-Perspective Data Overview | UC8 |
| `PATCH` | `/spoke/dg/overview/attr` | Update visualization config | Multi-Perspective Data Overview | UC8 |

### DataHub Pass-Through (`/hub`)

Optional ingress that forwards requests to DataHub GMS. Useful for clients that want a
single base URL. Authentication is still enforced by DataSpoke; the request is proxied
after JWT validation.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/hub/graphql` | Proxy DataHub GraphQL queries |
| `*` | `/hub/openapi/{path:path}` | Proxy DataHub REST OpenAPI endpoints (all methods) |

### Admin (`/admin`)

Routes for user management and system configuration. Accessible only to users with `"admin"` in the `groups` claim. Specific routes are defined in dedicated admin feature specs and are not catalogued here.

### System

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness check (no auth required) |
| `GET` | `/ready` | Readiness check (verifies DataHub, PostgreSQL, Redis connectivity) |

---

## Request & Response Conventions

These rules apply `API_DESIGN_PRINCIPLE_en.md` concretely to DataSpoke.

> **Style consistency**: All DataSpoke API endpoints must follow the conventions in this
> section uniformly — snake_case field names, ISO 8601 UTC timestamps, `offset`/`limit`
> for pagination, `from`/`to` for time-range filters, and `sort={field}_{asc|desc}` for
> ordering. Any deviation from these conventions requires explicit justification in the
> relevant feature spec.

### Field Naming

All request body and response fields use **snake_case**.

### Standard Response Envelope

All collection responses include a content key named after the resource + pagination
metadata:

```json
{
  "datasets": [
    { "urn": "urn:li:dataset:…", "name": "orders", "quality_score": 82 },
    { "urn": "urn:li:dataset:…", "name": "customers", "quality_score": 91 }
  ],
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 20,
  "total_count": 143,
  "resp_time": "2026-02-27T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Single-resource responses return the object directly with `resp_time` at the top level:

```json
{
  "urn": "urn:li:dataset:…",
  "name": "orders",
  "quality_score": 82,
  "resp_time": "2026-02-27T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `offset` | integer | Pagination start (default `0`) |
| `limit` | integer | Page size (default `20`, max `100`) |
| `sort` | string | Field name + direction suffix `_asc` or `_desc`, e.g. `quality_score_desc`, `occurred_at_asc` |
| `from` | string (ISO 8601) | Start of time-range filter, inclusive; used on `result` and `event` endpoints |
| `to` | string (ISO 8601) | End of time-range filter, inclusive; used on `result` and `event` endpoints |
| `q` | string | Natural language query (search endpoints only) |

### Meta-Classifier Conventions

`attr`, `method`, and `event` sub-resources follow the `API_DESIGN_PRINCIPLE_en.md`
definitions:

- `attr` — Read or update a subset of resource attributes (configuration, thresholds,
  visualization settings). Use `GET` to read, `PATCH` to update partial fields.
- `method` — Business actions that go beyond CRUD: `run`, `approve`, `reject`,
  `apply`, `generate`, `reindex`. Always `POST`. Use `?dry_run=true` for no-write mode
  instead of separate dry-run paths.
- `event` — Immutable history log of occurrences on a resource. Always `GET`; supports
  `offset`/`limit` pagination and `sort=occurred_at_desc` (default order, newest first).
  Supports `from`/`to` for time-range filtering. Sub-paths may be defined in feature specs
  to narrow by outcome (e.g. `.../event/failure`, `.../event/success`), but the parent `.../event`
  path must remain and return all event types. All events returned at `.../event` and any
  of its sub-paths must share a **uniform top-level JSON structure** — the same field
  names and types (e.g. `event_type`, `occurred_at`, `status`, `detail`) — so that
  clients can process them generically even when event types differ.

### Date/Time

All timestamps use ISO 8601 with UTC: `2026-02-27T10:00:00.000Z`.

## Middleware Stack

Requests pass through middleware in the following order:

```
Incoming Request
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 1. CORS                 │  Allow configured origins; reject others with 403
├─────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Request Logging      │  Log method, path, trace ID, client IP (before handler)
├─────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Auth (JWT Validate)  │  Verify signature, expiry, extract claims

└─────────────────────────┘
       │
       ▼
Outgoing Response
```

### Trace ID

Every request is assigned a `X-Trace-Id` (UUID v4) at layer 2. If the client provides
`X-Trace-Id` in the request headers, that value is reused. The trace ID is included in
all log lines and in every response header.

---

## Error Catalogue

All errors follow the standard envelope:

```json
{
  "error_code": "DATASET_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "No dataset found for URN 'urn:li:dataset:unknown'.",
  "trace_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

WebSocket connections follow the same authentication model as REST: the client must send
a valid JWT in the first message after opening the connection.

### Connection Handshake

```
Client                        DataSpoke API
  │                                │
  │── WS upgrade ─────────────────►│
  │                                │
  │── {"type":"auth",              │
  │    "token":"<access_token>"} ──►│
  │                                │── validate JWT
  │◄── {"type":"auth_ok"} ─────────│
  │                                │   (stream begins)
  │◄── {"type":"progress", …} ─────│
  │◄── {"type":"result", …} ───────│
  │                                │── server closes on completion
```

If auth fails, the server sends `{"type":"auth_error","error_code":"UNAUTHORIZED"}` and
closes the connection.

### Validation Progress Stream (`/spoke/common/data/{dataset_urn}/stream/validation`)

Messages sent during a validation run:

```json
{"type": "progress", "step": "fetch_aspects", "pct": 20, "msg": "Fetching DataHub aspects"}
{"type": "progress", "step": "compute_score", "pct": 60, "msg": "Computing quality score"}
{"type": "progress", "step": "anomaly_detect", "pct": 80, "msg": "Running anomaly detection"}
{"type": "result",
 "status": "completed",
 "quality_score": 78,
 "issues": [{"type": "freshness", "severity": "warning", "detail": "Last updated 3 days ago"}],
 "recommendations": ["Review freshness SLA", "Add ownership tag"]}
```

### Metric Update Stream (`/spoke/dg/metric/stream`)

Pushed when the Temporal metrics collection workflow emits an update:

```json
{"type": "metric_update",
 "metric_id": "poorly-documented-datasets",
 "measured_at": "2026-02-27T10:00:00.000Z",
 "value": 42,
 "alarm": false}
```
