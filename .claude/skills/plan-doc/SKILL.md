```

**Routing rules:**
- Top-level `spec/` — project-wide documents only. Do NOT create new top-level files unless the topic affects the whole system and warrants an architectural-level document.
- `spec/feature/` — common/cross-cutting feature deep-dives that are not specific to a single user group (e.g. `API.md`, `DEV_ENV.md`, shared infrastructure).
- `spec/feature/spoke/` — user-group-specific feature deep-dives. These map to features defined in the MANIFESTO under DE, DA, or DG groups. Examples: `INGESTION.md` (DE), `ONLINE_VALIDATOR.md` (DE/DA), `NL_SEARCH.md` (DA), `METRICS_DASHBOARD.md` (DG).
- `spec/impl/` — chronological implementation plans/logs. Used for decision records, implementation notes, rollout plans, and minor changes. Written as a living log where new entries are prepended. **File names must be `YYYYMMDD_<topic_slug>.md` — date-prefixed and fully lowercase with underscores** (e.g., `20260216_rewrite_plan.md`).

**How to decide between `feature/` and `feature/spoke/`:**
- If the feature belongs to a specific user group in the MANIFESTO (DE/DA/DG) → `feature/spoke/`
- If the feature is cross-cutting infrastructure, shared across groups, or not user-group-specific → `feature/`
- When in doubt, check the MANIFESTO's "Features by User Group" section

---

## Step 1 — Read context

Always read these before writing:
- `spec/MANIFESTO_en.md` — canonical user-group taxonomy and naming (highest authority)
- `spec/ARCHITECTURE.md` — components, tech stack, data flows, feature-to-architecture mapping, shared services (Ontology Builder, Quality Score Engine), deployment

Additionally, read these when relevant to the topic:
- `spec/DATAHUB_INTEGRATION.md` — when the feature involves DataHub read/write/event patterns
- `spec/API_DESIGN_PRINCIPLE_en.md` — when designing API endpoints
- `spec/USE_CASE_en.md` — for use case context (UC1–UC8)

If writing about a specific feature, also check for an existing `spec/feature/<FEATURE>.md` or `spec/feature/spoke/<FEATURE>.md` to extend rather than create a duplicate.

---

## Step 2 — Determine destination and document type from `$ARGUMENTS`

| Destination | When to use | Document type |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `spec/feature/spoke/<FEATURE>.md` | User-group-specific feature from the MANIFESTO: DE (Ingestion, Online Validator, Doc Suggestions), DA (NL Search, Text-to-SQL Metadata, Validator), DG (Metrics Dashboard, Multi-Perspective Overview) | Spoke Feature Spec (see template A) |
| `spec/feature/<FEATURE>.md` | Common/cross-cutting feature not specific to one user group (API design, dev environment, shared services) | Common Feature Spec (see template A, without user-group context) |
| `spec/impl/YYYYMMDD_<topic>.md` | Decision plan, ADR, implementation note, rollout plan, minor change, or anything with a specific date/milestone | Plan Log (see template B) |
| `spec/<DOC>.md` (top-level) | Only for project-wide topics that belong alongside MANIFESTO and ARCHITECTURE | Top-level spec (use template A without feature context) |

---

## Step 3 — Write the document

Use the template for the chosen destination. Follow these style rules for both:
- H1 title
- H2 section headings, H3 sub-headings
- ASCII diagrams for component/flow illustrations
- Tables for comparisons and field definitions
- Code blocks for schemas, interfaces, API examples
- User group names must match the MANIFESTO exactly: **DE** (Data Engineering), **DA** (Data Analysis), **DG** (Data Governance)
- Feature names must match the MANIFESTO: **Deep Technical Spec Ingestion**, **Online Data Validator**, **Automated Documentation Suggestions**, **Natural Language Search**, **Text-to-SQL Optimized Metadata**, **Enterprise Metrics Time-Series Monitoring**, **Multi-Perspective Data Overview**
- Product name is always `DataSpoke` (no space)
- API URIs follow the three-tier pattern: `/api/v1/spoke/common/…` (shared), `/api/v1/spoke/[de|da|dg]/…` (user-group), `/api/v1/hub/…` (DataHub pass-through)
- For DataHub integration details, reference `DATAHUB_INTEGRATION.md` rather than duplicating SDK patterns or aspect catalogs
- For API convention details, reference `API_DESIGN_PRINCIPLE_en.md` rather than restating URI/response format rules
- When referencing architecture-level concepts (shared services, data flows, tech stack), align with `ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Template A — Feature Spec (`spec/feature/spoke/<FEATURE>.md` or `spec/feature/<FEATURE>.md`)

No version/date/author metadata block. This is a timeless reference document.

For spoke features, include the user group tag. For common features, omit it.

```markdown
# <Feature Name>

> **User Group**: <DE | DA | DG | DE/DA (shared)>
> (omit this line for common features in spec/feature/)

2. [Goals & Non-Goals](#goals--non-goals)
3. [Design](#design)

5. [Interfaces](#interfaces)

## Template B — Plan Log (`spec/impl/YYYYMMDD_<topic>.md`)

Chronological log style. New entries go at the **top** (newest first).
Each entry has a date header and structured content.

```markdown
# <Topic Name>

<!-- Newest entries at the top. -->

---

## YYYY-MM-DD — <Entry Title>

**Context**: Why this decision or plan is being written now.

**What**: What is changing or being decided.

**Why**: Rationale, trade-offs considered.

**Action items**:
- [ ] item

## YYYY-MM-DD — <Earlier Entry Title>

...
```

---

## Step 4 — Update cross-references if needed

- If a new `spec/feature/` or `spec/feature/spoke/` document introduces components or data models that belong in the architecture overview, update `spec/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- If the document changes how a use case is realized, note it in `spec/USE_CASE_en.md` as a cross-reference.
- Never modify `spec/MANIFESTO_en.md` or `spec/MANIFESTO_kr.md`.
